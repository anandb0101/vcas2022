<p>Prof. S. Wabnitz obtained the Laurea Degree in Electronics Engineering from Sapienza University of Rome in 1982,
  the MS in Electrical Engineering from Caltech in 1983, and the PhD in Applied Electromagnetism from the
   Italian Ministry of Education in 1988. He was with the Ugo Bordoni Foundation between 1985 and 1996. 
   In 1996 he became full professor in Physics at the University of Burgundy in Dijon, France. Between 1999 
   and 2003 he was with Alcatel Research and Innovation Labs in France and with Xtera Communications in Texas. 
   Since 2007 until 2018 he was full professor at the University of Brescia, Italy. Since November 2018 he is 
   full professor in telecom at the Department of Information, 
 Electronics and Telecom Engineering of Sapienza University of Rome. 
 His research activities involve nonlinear propagation effects in optical communications and information 
 processing devices. He is the author and co-author of over 700 international refereed papers, conference 
 presentations, and book chapters. He is the Editor-in-Chief of Elsevier’s Optical Fiber Technology, a Fellow 
 member of the Optical Society of America, and senior member of IEEE-Photonics Society.</p>
 <h3>Title of the Talk: Spatiotemporal beam shaping with multimode optical fibers</h3>
 <p><b>Abtract of Talk:</b>We experimentally study the spatial, temporal and spectral shaping of femtosecond pulse laser beams by using nonlinear multimode optical fibers. Conditions for the generation of walk-off solitons are revealed, and the self-cleaning of multimode Raman solitons is demonstrated. Exotic wave shaping phenomena include the spontaneous generation of rainbow spiral and helical beams carrying orbital angular momentum.</p>
