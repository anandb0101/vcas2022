 <h3>Title of the Talk: MIMO Antennas for 5G Applications</h3>
 <p><b>Abstract of Talk:</b>In the last few decades, the ever-growing demand for high data rate in wireless communication has compelled the antenna engineering community to look for a technology that can provide high data rate within a limited frequency spectrum. Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) technology is one of the promising solutions for this, where multiple antennas are used in both transmitting and receiving ends. In such MIMO systems, multiple independent channels are created, which enhance the data rate significantly, without any additional requirement of bandwidth or transmitting power. In this talk the design challenges for MIMO Antenna System would be presented and discussed. Some state-of-the-art MIMO antenna systems proposed by our group will also be presented.</p>
